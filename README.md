- 👋 Hi, I’m @piechartgraphicdesign
- 👀 I’m interested in data visualization, but I don't know how to code anything (so what am I doing here?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use this interface as step one. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing, really, since I can't offer anything in return. I am just a learner at the most basic level. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
